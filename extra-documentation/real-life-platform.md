# Guide to making a real-life Stewart Platform replicate the simulation software movements

In my project

## How to correctly measure the platform's parameters

## How to measure the calibration values of the servos

## Issues that remain unsolved to this date

    - skewing of image when large size
    - only integer values accepted in cheap servos
    - calibration data hard to get precisely
    - only 2 or 3 animations accepted at the same time (memory issues)
    - number of steps limited to 2056 (memory issues)
